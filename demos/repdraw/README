Ada SOM RepDraw Demo
--------------------

The files in this directory demonstrate the use of replication
and the event manager in an Ada SOM client program.  You should
copy them to a directory where you have write access before
attempting to run this demo.

This demo relies on the AdaXlibXt bindings, which are free
software distributed with PowerAda.  These bindings must be 
compiled and the environment variable ADAXLIBXTHOME set to point
to the directory under which they are installed before this
demo program can be run.  By default, the source for these
bindings can be found under $POWERADA/../contrib/AdaXlibXt.

Makefile     - Builds the repdraw program
alib.list    - Names needed sublibraries 
README       - This file
repdraw.ada  - The Ada client program
run.sh       - Builds and Runs the client program
tablet.c     - The server, implemented in C
tablet.idl   - IDL for the replicated "testobj".

You must execute this demo in an X-Windows environment.
It will:

 - Set up a SOM environment based on the setting of the POWERADA
   environment variable
 - Create C header files from tablet.idl to allow compilation
   of the C server program
 - Compile the C server program, creating an object file which
   will be included when the Ada client is linked
 - Create an Ada interface from tablet.idl
 - Create an alib.list file and initialize the working sublibrary
 - Compile and link the Ada client program
 - Start two copies of the client program.  

Each copy of the program will have its own window.  Clicking and
dragging the left mouse button in either window will draw lines
in both.  The two windows need not be opened on the same display.
Setting a different DISPLAY environment variable for one invocation
will allow you to share the drawing area between two workstations.

This demo is based on the the sample program in 
   /usr/lpp/som/samples/somr/c/repdraw
or
   /usr/lpp/somtk/samples/somr/c/repdraw
