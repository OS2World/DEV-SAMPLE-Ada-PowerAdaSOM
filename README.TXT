This directory contains source, libraries, demos, and
documentation describing the integration of PowerAda 2.2 and SOM 2.x.

If you would like to learn more about using SOM and CORBA with PowerAda
you should read chapter 17 from the PowerAda 2.2 User's Guide in
doc/ug17som.ps. This is a PostScript document that may be printed or
viewed with a tool like ghostview.    You can also use an html browser
such as those used for PowerAda's online help to view the file 
html/ug17som.html and those it's linked to.

Most of the demos and documentation assume that the source in the
`bindings' subdirectory is compiled into $POWERADA/lib/som in Ada95
mode, but this is no longer the case.  You can build your own
equalivalent library from powerada by creating a working project with
$POWERADA/contrib/som as its parent, Visiting the bindings directory,
selecting all the files there, and `Compile' from the Build menu, then
clicking `Compile'.
